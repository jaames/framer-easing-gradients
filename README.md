# NOTICE

This project is deprecated, and I'm not longer working on Framer components (unless you want to buy me a Framer subscription :P). Use [Benjamin den Boer's Easing Gradient Component](https://packages.framer.com/package/benjamin/easing-gradient) instead!

---

[Easing gradient](https://larsenwork.com/easing-gradients/) component for Framer X, inspired by @larsenwork's sketch-easing-gradient plugin. 

### Features

* Multiple easing types (linear, ease, ease-in, ease-out, ease-in-out, stepped)
* Additional color spaces for smoother color mixing
* More coming soon!
